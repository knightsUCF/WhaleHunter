<h1>To Do:</h1>



- get new feeds to write to database

- get order functionality working for different brokers

- create a method to detect the timing interval of querries in the database. Based on this timing interval calculate the appropriate lookback ratio.

- consider fastest transfer times (litecoin / raiblocks)
